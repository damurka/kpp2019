\describe{
\item{county}{Name of the county in Kenya}
\item{age}{Age group in 5-year intervals (e.g., "0-4", "5-9", ..., "80+")}

\description{
This dataset provides base and projected population distributions by county,
age group, gender, and year for Kenya from 2020 to 2035 in \strong{annual increments}.
It includes population estimates derived from the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census
and subsequent projections by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).
}
\details{
The \code{pop1} dataset can be used to analyse demographic trends, plan resource allocation,
and study population dynamics in Kenya over the specified years. The projections
take into account factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and migration
patterns. The age groups are provided in 5-year intervals, and the population
estimates are updated annually from 2020 to 2035.

\strong{Note:}
\itemize{
\item The "Total" gender category represents the combined population of both males and females.
\item The "All Ages" age category represents the combined ages of all age groups.
